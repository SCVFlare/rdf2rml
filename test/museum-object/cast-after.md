Let's consider the following situation:
- `npg/constituent/1` made copies of two works by older masters:
- he made an artistic copy `npg/object/1` of a work by `npg/constituent/2`
- he made a literal copy `npg/object/2` of a work by `npg/constituent/3` from a mold (cast)
(Remember we don't have links to these older works)
