# Blank Node Types

Blank node types occur in owl:Restriction and similar constructs.

These are tests for  https://github.com/VladimirAlexiev/rdf2rml/issues/10

Before this issue was fixed, we used a wrong prop name `rdfs:type1` instead of `rdf:type` (also called `a`) to see how the diagram will look like.
